# Portofolio Project- Personal Trainer Page

Portfolio is the very first website I ever created and it includes almost all the knowledge I gathered in 9 weeks by studying HTML and CSS courses in Business College Helsinki. During this time I was guided by the teachers with clear instrunctions on how to implement every feature. The topic is related to one of my passions that is fitness and aims people who would like to get in a better shape.
